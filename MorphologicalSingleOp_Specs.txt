Project 7.B specs
*************************************
Your project 7.B will re-use the entire code of your project 7.A with the following
modifications:
1) adding a third input argument, argv[3], as the user's choice of 
which morphological operation to the image binary image in argv[1] 
using the structuring element  in argv[2]. 
The value of argv[3] is a character:
	D for dilation
	E for Erosion
	O for Opening
	C for Closing
2) the program perform only a single morphological opertion requested by the user, given in argv[3]
3) the program only need to write he result of that operation to the output file in argv[4]
for future processing, no other outputs are required as in your project 7.A.
